##  Ordinal Punk Pixel Heads on Bitcoin!? So what? Do I care?

The official blurb on the Ordinal Punks
website - [ordinalpunks.com](https://ordinalpunks.com/) - reads:

Guess what?

Yes, the "open source algorithm"
is the (crypto) punk's not dead punk text-to-image generator.

## The Bitcoin "Narrative" or "Are You Orange Pilled Yet?" (before Ordinal Theory, February 2023)

The (big) lies the fraudsters tell / told you...

- Bitcoin is the new gold
- Bitcoin is the new gold standard (and the best store of value and world reserve)
- Bitcoin is the new internet (of value / money)
- Bitcoin proof-of-work / waste hashing is creating "intrinsic" value
- Bitcoin proof-of-work / waste hashing power is a measure of the strength of the network
- Bitcoin mining is free (the coinbase block rewards are freebies)
- Bitcoin mining is the beginning of a renewable energy revolution
- Bitcoin HODLing creates wealth
- Bitcoin is a singularity - no copies ever possible (or accepted) - Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision (BSV) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC) and is NOT Bitcoin Cash (BCH)...
- Bitcoin is the beginning of a new era of world peace
- Bitcoin makes wars impossible - no more buying weapons with inflated national money or on public credit
- Bitcoin is the beginning of a new era of a trust-less "honest" banking and decentralized austrian finance utopia - no scams, no wash trading, no money laundering, no ponzis, no million dollar banker bonuses, no hedge fund speculation, no central banks, ...
- Bitcoin is banking the unbanked poor and unwashed
- And many more lies  (Are You Orange-Pilled Yet?)



## The new Bitcoin "narrative" (starting February 2023):

Enter Ordinal Theory and Bitcoin Inscriptions


Yeah, we found a use for Bitcon!  It's a database!

"Ulta-sound"  ~~money~~  .jpegs!
Yes, monkeys, punks, goblins, and more!

"inscribed", that is, written into the bitcoin blockchain, that is, an open (shared) public database.


Limitations:   4 MB max. (per block)
and - of course - you have to pay for every byte  (or vbyte) stored
in bitcoins.
Funny money for funny monkeys!

Okkie - What took so long!?

- Bitcon Maxis!
- Small Blockers vs Big Blockers
- Bitcoin Gold vs Bitcoin Cash
- Burn Planet Earth vs Change the Code, Not the Climate
- etc.



Bitcoin "Small Blocker" Maxis won the "crypto (bitcon) wars":

Early "investors"  in the pyramid scheme
HODL! HODL! HODL!
and enforce ever more limits / restrictions
on transactions and "inscriptions" =>
make bitcoin "super-rare" collectibles
and "ultra-sound" money / gold

e.g.
- 2 MB block limit
- 80 byte limit on OP_RETURN "inscriptions"
- and so on

##  Ordinal Theory Q & A with Casey Rodarmor

From the Official [Ordinal Theory F.A.Q.](https://docs.ordinals.com/faq.html) written by Casey Rodarmor

**Q: What is ordinal theory?**

A: Ordinal theory is a protocol for assigning serial numbers to satoshis, the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin, and tracking those satoshis as they are spent by transactions.


Aside - What's a Satoshi?

- 1 bitcoin is 100 million satoshis (1 = 100 000 000 = 10^8)
- 1 euro or 1 dollar is 100 cents (1 = 100 = 10^2)


Aside - Q: What are Ordinal Numbers?   (let's ask Chat GPT)

A: Ordinal numbers refer to numbers that indicate the position
or order of "digital artefacts" in a collection,
such as genesis ("birth"), first, second, third, fourth,
and so on.

Note: Ordinal numbers do NOT indicate
quantity as cardinal numbers do.




**Q: Does ordinal theory require a side chain, a separate token, or changes to bitcoin?**

A: Nope! Ordinal theory works right now, without a side chain, and the only token needed is bitcoin itself.


![](https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/raw/master/i/fake-dilbert-blockchain.png)


**Q: What is ordinal theory good for?**

A: Collecting, trading, and scheming. Ordinal theory assigns identities to individual satoshis, allowing them to be individually tracked and traded, as curios and for numismatic value.

Ordinal theory also enables inscriptions, a protocol for attaching arbitrary content to individual satoshis, turning them into bitcoin-native digital artifacts.



Aside - Ordinal Theory Magic Money Miracle:

Before (ordinal theory and "curios"):
- 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi

After:
- 1 satoshi is 11.5 bitcoins (or 1 150 000 000 satoshis) ;-),
  that is, sell your "curio" ordinal
  satoshi for  bitcoins (current all-time record is 11.5 for an ordinal punk).

the merged blocks are kind-of-buggy (male/female blocks mixed-up).

New (experimental) protocols built on inscriptions

###  Inside Inscriptions  (Opcode Layout / "Envelope")

Inscription content is serialized using data pushes within unexecuted conditionals,
called "envelopes". Envelopes consist of an `OP_FALSE` `OP_IF` ... `OP_ENDIF`
wrapping any number of data pushes.
Because envelopes are effectively no-ops,
they do not change the semantics of the script in which they are included,
and can be combined with any other locking script.

A text inscription containing the string "Hello, world!" is serialized as follows:

```
OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  OP_PUSH "ord"
  OP_1
  OP_PUSH "text/plain;charset=utf-8"
  OP_0
  OP_PUSH "Hello, world!"
OP_ENDIF
```

First the string ord is pushed, to disambiguate inscriptions from other uses of envelopes.

`OP_1` indicates that the next push contains the content type,
and `OP_0` indicates that subsequent data pushes contain the content itself. Multiple data pushes must be used for large inscriptions, as one of taproot's few restrictions is that individual data pushes may not be larger than 520 bytes.

### Bitcoin Timeline & Milestones Leading to Ordinal Inscriptions

**2009**

"Chancellor on the Brink of Second Ballout for Banks"  in Genesis Bitcoin Block No. 0 -
arguably the first data ever inscribed by Satoshi Nakamoto


**2011**

Namecoin - bitcoin "side chain" to register names started - attach value (data) to names (keys) up to 520 bytes

Aside - What is a "side chain"?

A sidechain is a blockchain whose consensus rules necessarily
involve validating data from another blockchain
(referred to as the parent chain).
The concept of sidechains was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010,
and was first tried in production by Namecoin in October 2011.


**2012**

Colored Coins - "coloring" coins, that is, satoshis to encode unique digital tokens / assets on bitcoin itself (no "side chain")


**2014**

OP_RETURN introduces an 80 bytes limit for data

Counterparty & OmniLayer (formerly Mastercoin)  - new "protocols" for unique digital tokens / assets

Quantum  minted (via [Namecoin Block No. 174923](https://namebrow.se/name/d41b8540cbacdf1467cdc5d17316dcb672c8b43235fa16cde98e79825b68709a/))
by Kevin McCoy (b. 1967) on May 2nd, 2014  - arguably the first ever
digital certified ownership (or provenance) "non-fungible token"
for digital art than called "monegraph" short for "monetized graphics".

Trivia Aside - Namecoin records expire (without renewal after 250 days)
and "EarlyNFT" snapped up the record via namecoin to assert ownership via the blockchain title / deed
while  McCoy and Sotheby's were auctioning the "Quantum NFT" in 2021.

**2015**

Blocksize Wars begin

Spells of Genesis (Trading Card Collectible Game)  via Counterparty

**2016**

Rare Pepes - The first Rare Pepes  were mined on Bitcoin Block No. 428 919.
The Rare Pepe images on Counterparty looked like trading cards
and were minted in limited amounts (a total of 1 774 across 36 series).
Through the Rare Pepe Wallet, users could buy, sell, and store  Rare Pepe cards.


**2017**

Segregated Witness "SegWit" Bitcoin "Soft Fork" Protcol Upgrade - the 4MB limit introduced on blocks

**2021**

TapRoot Bitcoin "Soft Fork" Protocl Upgrade - new Taproot scripts introduced; data limit relaxed


**2022**

Ordinals client released to the public by Casey Rodarmor


**2023**

First ever 4MB inscription
(a .jpeg image in the [Taproot Wizard series](https://www.taprootwizards.com/) by Udi Wertheimer)
 minted (and mined by Luxor pool)

> Last night, we made history. The gatekeepers tried to censor us.
>
> But we mined the LARGEST BLOCK and LARGEST TRANSACTION IN BITCOIN'S HISTORY
>
> Special thanks to bitcoin full node operators
> for supporting our efforts and hosting our 4MB inscription
> for all eternity!

Inscription volume explodes - 500 000 and counting...
