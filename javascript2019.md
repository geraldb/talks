##  JavaScript is Eating the World!? - Atwood's JavaScript Law

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript,
> will eventually be written in
> JavaScript.
>
> -- Jeff Atwood, Co-Founder of Stackoverflow, 2007

All applications will ultimately wind up on the web and
therefore must be written in JavaScript (or WebAssembly).




## JavaScript is Eating the World!? - Always Bet on JavaScript

> I usually finish with a joke: **Always bet on JavaScript.**

jQuery in 2019?

"Use the platform" always win (because native is faster)

(DOM) Queries with CSS selectors now built into all (modern) browsers

``` js
$('.my #awesome selector');
```

vs

``` js
document.querySelectorAll('.my #awesome selector');
```

More fluid / beautiful / convenient functions.
Example - Loops:

``` js
$.each(array, function(i, item){

});
```

vs

``` js
array.forEach(function(item, i){

});
```

## React in 2017

[Building Web Components with React.js - Past, Present, Future](https://github.com/geraldb/talks/blob/master/react.md)



## React vs Vue vs Svelte in 2019 - Hello, World!


**React**

All `.jsx`:

``` jsx
function Message( {name} ) {
  return <h1>{ `Hello, ${name}!` }</h1>;
}

<Message name="World" />
```

Note: JSX (JavaScript XML) adds XML syntax to JavaScript
and gets compiled (or really preprocessed):

``` js
function Message( {name} ) {
  return React.createElement( "h1", null, `Hello, ${name}!`);
}

React.createElement( Message, { name: "World" });
```



**Vue**

`.html`:

``` html
<div id="message">
  Hello, {{ name }}!
</div>
```

`.js`:

``` js
var msg = new Vue({
  el: '#message',
  data: {
    name: 'World'
  }
})
```

or use "single-file" component-style:

`.vue`:

```
<template>
  <div id="message">
    Hello, {{ name }}!
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: 'World'
  }
</script>
```



**Svelte**


`.svelte`:

```
<script>
	let name = 'World';
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```


## What's Svelte?

Cybernetically enhanced web apps!?


**Write Less Code** Build boilerplate-free components
using languages you already know - HTML, CSS and JavaScript

**No Virtual DOM** Svelte compiles your code to tiny,
framework-less vanilla JavaScript - your app starts fast and stays fast

**True reactive** No more complex state management libraries -
Svelete brings reactivity to JavaScript itself


See [`svelte.dev` »](https://svelte.dev/)




##  Occam's Razor - Less Code is More

> Occam's razor (also Ockham's razor)
> is the problem-solving principle that essentially states that
> "simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones."
> When presented with competing hypotheses to solve a problem, one should select
> the solution with the fewest assumptions.
> The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar
> William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.
>
> -- [Occam's razor @ Wikipedia]()

Question: How to decide what language (or "patterns") to use if you have
hundreds of choices?

Less code is more.
Less abstractions (and to the "metal"¹) is more.

¹: "Use the platform" always wins (because native is faster).

## React vs Vue vs Svelte in 2019 - Counter


**React**

`.jsx` - "classical" (pre-hooks):

``` jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(({ count }) => ({ count: count + 1 }));
  };

  render() {
    return
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.count}
      </button>;
  }
}

<Counter />
```

New: React "class-less" with hooks

`.jsx`:

``` jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {count}
    </button>;
}
```

What are Hooks?  Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8.
Hooks let you use state and other React goodies
without writing a class. (Source: [Introducing Hooks @ React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html))



**Vue**

`.vue`:

```
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">{{count}}</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() { return { count: 0 } },
  methods: {
    handleClick() { this.count += 1 }
  }
}
</script>
```


**Svelte**

`.svelte`:

```
<script>
	let count = 0;
	function handleClick() { count += 1; }
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
	Clicked {count}
</button>
```




## React vs Vue vs Svelte in 2019 - A+B=? Form

**Svelte**

`.svelte`:

```
<script>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={a}>
<input type="number" bind:value={b}>

<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
```


**React**

`.jsx` - "class-less" with hooks:

``` jsx
export default () => {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);

  function handleChangeA(event) { setA(+event.target.value); }
  function handleChangeB(event) { setB(+event.target.value); }

  return
    <>
      <input type="number" value={a} onChange={handleChangeA}/>
      <input type="number" value={b} onChange={handleChangeB}/>

      <p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
    </>;
};
```


**Vue**

`.vue`:

```
<template>
  <input type="number" v-model.number="a">
  <input type="number" v-model.number="b">

  <p>{{a}} + {{b}} = {{a + b}}</p>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data: function() {
      return {
        a: 1,
        b: 2
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```

Conclusion:

The example takes 442 characters in React,
and 263 characters in Vue,
to achieve something that takes 145 characters in Svelte.
The React version is literally three times larger!

## What's Next? JavaScript in 2016

### What's Next? JavaScript w/ Types

Biggies

- TypeScript ★48127 (20098¹) (by Microsoft) -  JavaScript Extended w/ Types
- Flow ★19356 (10693¹) (by Facebook)        -  Add Annotations for Type Checking
- Dart ★3521 (1038¹) (by Google)           -  New Language w/ (Optional) Types

And Others.

¹: Stars in July 2016


### What's Next? More Fun - Fun(ctional) Languages

Biggies

- Elm ★ 5161 (3706)¹ (by Evan Czaplicki 'n' friends) - Small (Pure) Functional Language for the Web
  - Based on Haskell (Simplified)
- ReasonML ★7610 (2467)¹ (by Facebook) - Larger (Pragmatic) Functional Language
  - Based on OCaml (New ReasonML Syntax Closer to JavaScript)

And Others.

¹: Stars in July 2016


Why Fun(ctional)?

- "Stronger" Types
  - No Null and No Undefined Possible
    - e.g. Elm Uses Maybe types with Just a and Nothing and Tuple Units e.g. `()`)
  - Lists must always be of the same type
  - If expressions must always return the same type (in if and else branch)
  - Case expressions must always cover all possible branches / values
  - And so on
- Immutability
  - Cannot change/overwrite variables (change will always create a new variable)
  - Great for "high-speed" diffing web component/element trees ("just" compare node references)
  - Great for "time travel" debugging e.g. save or restore any state in time


## Homework - Practice (or Learn) Functional Programming :-)

**Counter Example with Elm**

Homework. Practice (or Learn) Functional Programming with Elm  :-)

**Counter Example with ReasonML (and React)**

Homework. Practice (or Learn) Functional Programming with ReasonML  :-)



## Counter Example with Elm

``` elm
type Msg = Tick

model : Int
model = 0

view : Int -> Html.Html Msg
view model =
      button [ onClick Tick ] [ text (toString model) ]

update : Msg -> Int -> Int
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Add -> model + 1
```




## Counter Example with ReasonML (and React) and Timer (Side) Effect

``` reasonml
type action =
  | Tick;

type state = {
  count: int,
};

[@react.component]
let make = () => {
  let (state, dispatch) = React.useReducer(
    (state, action) =>
      switch (action) {
      | Tick => {count: state.count + 1}
      },
    {count: 0}
  );

  React.useEffect0(() => {
    let timerId = Js.Global.setInterval(() => dispatch(Tick), 1000);
    Some(() => Js.Global.clearInterval(timerId))
  });

  <div>{ReasonReact.string(string_of_int(state.count))}</div>;
};
```


## Many More Languages

Java:

- Scala.js - A safer way to build robust front-end web applications!
- Kotlin.js - Kotlin for JavaScript
- ClojureScript - Clojure to JavaScript compiler
- and many more


CoffeScript, Opal (Ruby), Brython (Python),
and many many more.

See [List of languages that compile to JavaScript »](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js)



## JavaScript + WebAssembly

- "Higher-Level" Language - JavaScript
- "Lower-Level" Language - WebAssembly (formerly asm.js)


## What's WebAssembly?

Compile C, C++, Rust, and more "system" languages
to "Lower-Level" JavaScript. Use compiled code as WebAssembly modules / libraries
(almost runs with "native" speed) in JavaScript.


See [`webassembly.org »`](https://webassembly.org)




## Official WebAssembly Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers)

**Q: Is WebAssembly trying to replace JavaScript?**

A: No! WebAssembly is designed to be a complement to, not replacement of, JavaScript. While WebAssembly will, over time, allow many languages to be compiled to the Web, JavaScript has an incredible amount of momentum and will remain the single, privileged (as described above) dynamic language of the Web. Furthermore, it is expected that JavaScript and WebAssembly will be used together in a number of configurations:

Whole, compiled C++ apps that leverage JavaScript to glue things together.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI around a main WebAssembly-controlled center canvas, allowing developers to leverage the power of web frameworks to build accessible, web-native-feeling experiences.

Mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript app with a few high-performance WebAssembly modules (e.g., graphing, simulation, image/sound/video processing, visualization, animation, compression, etc., examples which we can already see in asm.js today) allowing developers to reuse popular WebAssembly libraries just like JavaScript libraries today.

When WebAssembly gains the ability to access garbage-collected objects,
those objects will be shared with JavaScript, and not live in a walled-off world of their own.
