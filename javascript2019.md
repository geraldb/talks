# JavaScript in 2019 - Teach Yourself Web Programming in ~24 Hours~ 10 Minutes


## Silicon Valley Mantra - Software is Eating the World

Q: Who's going to write all that code?

<!--
- [ ] You
- [ ] Robots
- [ ] Let's Go Shopping / Let's Buy
- [ ] Other, Please Tell

Q: And in what programming language(s)?



## Trivia Quiz - Q: What's the world's most popular programming language?

- [ A ] JavaScript
- [ B ] Python
- [ C ] C
- [ D ] Java
- [ ? ] Other, Please Tell


##  JavaScript is eating the world!?

> I usually finish with a joke: **Always bet on JavaScript.**
>
> -- [Brendan Eich](https://brendaneich.com), Inventor of JavaScript

Remember:

(Sun/Oracle) JavaFX[1]
vs (Adobe) Flash/ActionScript
vs (Microsoft) Silverlight/.NET
vs HTML/JavaScript

1: FX = Special (Visual Graphics) Effects

Java Applets, Java Web Start, ActiveX,
VBScript (Visual Basic Script),
Adobe AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime),
Google Gears,
Google Web Toolkit (GWT),
Google Native Client (NaCl),
and on and on and on.  FAIL. FAIL. FAIL.




## And the Winner is...

JavaScript for "higher-level" web (application) programming

WebAssembly (formerly asm.js) for "lower-level" web ("byte code") programming

Python for data science, machine learning and "casual" programming

C for systems programming

SQL for (relational) database queries

and so on.



## One Language to Rule Them All?! - Bits & Bytes Rule

It's just 0 and 1s.  Bits & Bytes.  Mix & Match.

JavaScript Trend: Assembly and Compiler (incl. Source-to-Source Compiler)
"Renaissance" in 2019 Continues => Ever More Choices - JavaScript Fatigue?!

##  Occam's Razor - Less Code is More

> Occam's razor (also Ockham's razor)
> is the problem-solving principle that essentially states that
> "simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones."
> When presented with competing hypotheses to solve a problem, one should select
> the solution with the fewest assumptions.
> The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar
> William of Ockham (c. 1287â€“1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.
>
> -- [Occam's razor @ Wikipedia]()

Question: How to decide what language (or "patterns") to use if you have
hundreds of choices?

Less code is more.
Less abstractions (and to the "metal"1:) is more.
More examples upcoming later.


1: "Use the platform" always wins (because native is faster).

## Less is More




## Compiler with New (Functional) Language (Haskell Syntax Style )

Elm

- built-in virtual dom / built-in reactive updates
- dom nodes are always unchangeable / immutable (by defintion)


Cons:

- "Radical" new syntax for Java or JavaScript coders
- "Radical" functional code (always typed and always unchangeable / immutable)



## Types, Types, Types

TypeScript   - Gradual Typing for JavaScript

ReasonML (OCaml Syntax)  - 100 % (Strong) Typing for JavaScript-like ReasonML



## Many More Languages

Java:
- Scala.js
- Kotlin.js
- Clojure.js

CoffeScript, PureScript, Opal (Ruby), Brython (Python),
and many many more.

See CoffeeScript Wiki Page - 100+




## JavaScript + WebAssembly
